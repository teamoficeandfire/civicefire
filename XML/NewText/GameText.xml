			<Text>The words of House Baratheon are &quot;Ours is the Fury.&quot; House Baratheon of Dragonstone is a cadet branch of House Baratheon. It was formed after the War of the Usurper when the newly-crowned King Robert I, named his younger brother, Stannis, the Prince of Dragonstone. Originally, Stannis used the crowned stag of House Baratheon, but during the War of the Five Kings he changed his banner to a crowned stag enclosed within a red heart surrounded by a blaze of orange fire on a field of sun yellow.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Baratheon was the youngest of the original great houses, tracing its descent from Orys Baratheon, one of Aegon I&#39;s fiercest generals, and rumored to be his bastard brother. Through the female line, the Baratheons are descended from the Storm Kings, as Orys slew Argilac the Arrogant, last of the Storm Kings, and married his daughter. Orys adopted the sigil and words of his wife&#39;s ancestral line. The line of the Storm Kings dates back to the Age of Heroes when their kingdom was founded by King Durran &quot;Godsgrief&quot; I, a legendary hero. After the War of the Usurper, the house claimed the Iron Throne in King&#39;s Landing and the Isle of Dragonstone, with the support of House Stark, House Tully, House Arryn, and eventually House Lannister.</Text>

			<Text>Stannis Baratheon is the eldest of Robert Baratheon&#39;s younger brothers. A brooding, humorless man known for a hard and unyielding sense of justice, he is obsessed with slights both real and imagined. He is well known for weathering a terrible seige durring the War of the Usurper through the use of a smuggler who brought them food. Later he punished the smuggler for his crime of smuggling, but knighted him for his help during the seige (this smuggler was later known as the Onion Knight). After the death of Robert, he styled himself king of the Seven Kingdoms as Robert&#39;s heir, though he has difficulty generating support for his claim. He has a cold relationship with his wife, Lady Selyse of House Florent, and they have one daughter, Shireen, a sad little girl bearing a disfigurement from an ailment.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After Robert&#39;s death, Stannis&#39;s brother Renly declared himself king. Through his charisma and familiarity with the Baratheon bannermen, he managed to win support from many houses -- despite Stannis having the better claim. Renly also won the support of the House Tyrell through a secret love affair with Loras Tyrell and a marriage to his sister Margaery Tyrell. He spent a great deal of time moving slowly through the south, gaining support and men while waiting for the right moment to strike. Renly hosted tournaments for his men while the Lannisters and Starks wore each other down. This plan went awry, however, when his brother Stannis laid siege to Storm&#39;s End which forced Renly to respond. Catelyn Stark convinced the men to parley, but Renly made light of the situation, refusing to back down from his claim and advising his brother to give up and have a nice peach from the Tyrell&#39;s Highgarden. While preparing for battle with his brother&#39;s forces, Renly was slain by Stannis&#39;s magic shade.

			<Text>Daenerys Targaryen, called Dany, and also known as Daenerys Stormborn, is the the daughter of King Aerys II and his wife Rhaella. Because most of her family was slain during Robert&#39;s Rebellion, when her mother died giving birth to her the Targaryen dynasty was reduced to only her older brother Viserys and herself.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Viserys and Daenerys considered themselves the rightful rulers of Westeros: Viserys III, King of the Seven Kingdoms, and his heiress-presumptive Daenerys, the Princess of Dragonstone. In the years that followed, she and Viserys wandered among the nine Free Cities looking for aid -- this earned Viserys the mocking title of &quot;the Beggar King&quot;. He was often a cruel, abusive companion, prone to mood swings and fits of violence. His abiding obsession was regaining the crown which he felt was his by bloodright. He instilled in Daenerys a similar belief: that reclaiming Westeros should be the paramount goal of her life. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the Free City of Pentos, the Targaryens were the guests of Illyrio Mopatis, a rich and powerful magister. Illyrio and Viserys arranged to marry the thirteen-year-old Daenerys to Khal Drogo, a great leader among the Dothraki people, who are nomadic horse lords. Viserys hoped to use the thousands of men in Drogo&#39;s khalasar to conquer Westeros. Despite Daenerys&#39;s fear and apprehension, she had no choice but to accept her brother&#39;s will and wed Drogo. During a drunken rage, Viserys broke Dothraki law by drawing a blade in the holy city, inciting Khal Drogo to &quot;crown&quot; him by dumping a pot of molten gold over his head. When Drogo suffered a life-threatening wound in battle, Daenerys commanded Mirri Maz Duur to heal him. But the maegi betrayed her, leaving Drogo a brain dead husk and slaying their son Rhaego in the womb. In Astapor, she purchased an army of elite eunuch slave soldiers called Unsullied by pretending to sell her dragon, Drogon. After taking control of the Unsullied, she reclaimed Drogon, commanding him to turn his fires on the Astapori leaders, and used the Unsullied to conquer the city. She hopes to travel across the ocean and use her army of unsullied to reclaim the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.</Text>

			<Text>The Night&#39;s Watch mans the Wall, a huge fortification built primarily of ice and located in the far north of Westeros. The Wall is 300 miles long (100 leagues), over 700 feet high; it extends from the Frostfangs mountain range in the west to the Bay of Seals in the east. According to Westerosi legend, it was built after the period known as The Long Night by the nearly mythical Brandon the Builder over 8,000 years ago. The Wall was constructed in an attempt to forever shut out the barbarian inhabitants of the far north who had overrun Westeros during that period. These &quot;Wildlings&quot; were turned back by unknown forces. Several mentions in ancient texts suggest that the Wall was much smaller at the time, having been built upon by the Night&#39;s Watch over the centuries to its present size. However, the severely reduced current Night&#39;s Watch is limited to maintenance duty. The greatest antagonist to the Watch has been the Others, a race of mystical creatures not seen for thousands of years.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For the vast majority of the Watch&#39;s recent history, they have served as a practical penal colony, filled with petty and violent criminals, political exiles, and vanquished nobility. Although their numbers are dwindling and the title of Brother of the Night&#39;s Watch no longer holds the honor and prestige it once did, the core of the Watch is still composed of capable and dedicated men. These men now serve the Watch and the Realm of Men by helping ensure that the barbaric human settlers of the areas north of the Wall, known as Wildlings, are not allowed to raid south of The Wall, which has been their ancient task all but forgotten by time and more practical modern concerns.</Text>

The only remaining trace of the dragons believed to be the stones which were reported to have once been dragon eggs and some giant skulls most of which are hidden beneath the Red Keep. Dragons are native to the continent of Essos, and were discovered some five thousand years ago by the Valyrians in the Fourteen Fires, a ring of volcanoes on the Valyrian Peninsula. The Valyrians mastered the art of raising dragons and used them as weapons of war to carve out a massive empire.

Valyrian steel blades are lighter, stronger, and sharper than even the best castle-forged steel, and feature distinctive rippled patterns similar to Damascus steel. Most Valyrian steel blades in Westeros are treasured heirlooms of noble houses, each with its own name and storied history. It is likely that most of the Valyrian steel swords were brought to westros by the Targaryens, after the Doom of Valyria. Only the greatest weaponsmiths can reforge swords from existing Valyrian steel, but the secret of creating such an alloy was apparently lost with Valyria, making those remaining weapons highly treasured and extremely rare. The blacksmiths of Qohor claim to know how to reforge Valyrian steel, and Tobho Mott did reforge Ice at the request of the Lannisters, in King&#39;s Landing. </Text>
